# Measuring distances to globular clusters in the Milky Way Galaxy
 This final year MPhys project measures the distances to the Palomar 5 (PAL5) and Palomar 13 (PAL13) globular clusters, with scope of extending to the IC4499 cluster, using data collected from the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope.
